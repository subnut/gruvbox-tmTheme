# gruvbox-tmTheme
Port of all .tmThemes from [Briles/gruvbox@`ec4eae233b`][commit]

That commit, as per my knowledge, is the last commit
that contains the `.tmTheme` files.

The [_bat-source_][batbranch] branch is being used in [bat][bat].  
The [_textmate_][tmbranch] branch is meant to be used in [TextMate][tm].
